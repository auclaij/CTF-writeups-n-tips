## Several writeups and tips/guides

Every year, I participate in several Capture The Flag, and every year, for the first hour, my mind goes blank.

I decided to regroup/write several writeups, uides and tips in my personal GitHub, which is intended for personal use.

But hey, I made the repo public so it may help some lost souls in the midst of a CTF :)
